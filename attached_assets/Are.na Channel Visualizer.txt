Product Requirements Document: 
1. Objective
Develop a web application that enables users to authenticate with the Are.na API, retrieve the contents of a specified channel, and display these contents as interactive card-like elements on an infinite canvas.
2. Key Features
* User Authentication: Allow users to connect to the Are.na public API using their authentication credentials.
* Channel Content Retrieval: Enable users to input an Are.na 'channel ID' and fetch all associated content via the Are.na API.
* Infinite Canvas Display: Render the retrieved text and images as card-like elements on an infinite canvas, facilitating seamless navigation and interaction.
* Interactive Elements: Provide functionalities such as zooming, panning, and rearranging cards to enhance user engagement with the canvas.
3. Functional Specifications
* Authentication:
   * Implement OAuth2 authentication to securely connect users to the Are.na API.
   * Store authentication tokens securely, adhering to best practices.
* Channel Retrieval:
   * Provide an input field for users to enter the Are.na channel ID.
   * Fetch channel contents, including text blocks and images, using the Are.na API endpoints.
* Canvas Rendering:
   * Display each content item as a draggable card on the canvas.
   * Ensure the canvas supports infinite scrolling in all directions.
   * Implement zoom and pan functionalities for intuitive navigation.
* User Interaction:
   * Allow users to drag and reposition cards.
   * Enable zooming in and out using mouse scroll or touch gestures.
   * Support panning across the canvas by clicking and dragging the background.
4. Technical Specifications
* Frontend:
   * Use React.js for building the user interface.
   * Integrate the tldraw SDK to manage the infinite canvas and interactive elements. (tldraw.dev)
* Backend:
   * Node.js with Express to handle API requests and user authentication.
   * Utilize the Are.na JavaScript API wrapper for streamlined API interactions. (github.com)
* Authentication:
   * Implement OAuth2 flow as per Are.na's API documentation. (dev.are.na)
* Canvas Functionality:
   * Leverage the tldraw SDK to provide an infinite canvas with support for zooming, panning, and object manipulation. (tldraw.dev)
5. User Interface Design
* Authentication Page:
   * Simple and intuitive login interface guiding users through the Are.na authentication process.
* Main Interface:
   * Input field for channel ID submission.
   * Infinite canvas displaying content cards.
   * Toolbar with controls for zooming, panning, and other interactions.
6. Performance Considerations
* Optimize rendering to handle large numbers of cards without compromising performance.
* Implement lazy loading for content to enhance responsiveness.
7. Security Considerations
* Ensure secure storage and transmission of authentication tokens.
* Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
